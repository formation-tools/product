** Why

To help inform:
- how to prioritize features
- which markets to target

** Objecive

Clearly explain why your product exists and your approach to running it. This could be a mission statement, tenets or principles. The important thing is that you believe in them, and by pinning them at he top of every roadmap it will be clear if what follows in the roadmap doesn't match your principles. [Ian McAllister, AirBnB]

** Product Vision Statement Examples
