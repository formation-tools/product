# BASECAMP

## Killer feature

The killer feature I would say is to be a simple to use all-in-one tool for project management. Basically you could manage a whole project tasks, internal and external communication and documentation with only basecamp.

## Home, Project Tools, Top Navigation

### Home

The starting point is an 'Home' where all projects and teams are listed.

[The Home Screen](/product/img/basecamp/home-screen.png)

### Top Navigation

There is a navigation bar on the top, which stays the same whatever project or team the user is working on. You can see it in the screenshot of the home screen.

There are 7 features accessible from there:

- _Home_, back to the home.
- _Lineup_, which shows a Ganntt chart, a visual timeline, of the project if a startinig and ending date are set.
- _Pings_, for private chat-messages to any other member of thee organisationi. You can ping single persons or also groups. Unlike all other communication means in Basecamp (Message Board and Campfire) they are private.
- _Hey_, where the new notification are shown. Hey.com is the mail service launche by Basecampo some years ago. With an hey.com email address it works also as a mail-inbox otherwise only activities, which the user is following or which the user is tagged are reported there.
- _Activity_ is where you check what is going on project-wide [activity screen one](/product/img/basecamp/activity.png):

  - All the latest activity
  - Someone's assignments
  - Overduee to-dos
  - Someone's activity
  - To do's addded & completed
  - Upcoming dates

  For further information check [this manual page](https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/93-reports#activity)

- _My Stuff_, a tab with links to tools related to the user: assignments, bookmarks, schedule, drafts, recenty activity, boosts. Bookmarks are anything 'starred' by the user, it could be a post in the discussion board of a file. Boosts are short 'shout out' (as far I understand) users can add in documents.

- _Find_, to find stuff.

### Project Tools

An organisation, a company, is divided in teams and projects[^1].
Every project has a dashboard with six standard tools[^2]:

- _message board_, a slack-like place for team/project-wide announcements, with the possibility of building threads. You can ◊assign a pre-defined category to the post. All posts are shown on the board but it’s possible to filter them out based on their category.
- _campfire_, is a team/project-wide chat, like Whatsapp. To ping single persons there is a chat-tool in the main top navigation bar, which is project/team independent.
- _docs & files_, is the repository for the documentation. They have an editor and you can create your own files. Anyone in the team/project can edit the file. Every change is reported in a change history. People are not notified when a document is changed, but when someone post a comment regarding the document. When you edit or read the document, the lower part of the screen is dedicated to the comments. It’s not possible real time collaboration is not possible. You always need to save the document. It is possible also to upload documents or link documents from other services like Google Docs. Also in this case for people to be notified that a document was changed, the editor should write a comment. In the main view of a document created with the in-house editor you see the last person who edited it and when. It’s not possible to download single documents created with the in-house editor but it is possible to download the folder containing them. The in-house files are then exported as html files.
- _To do’s_, is the task manager of the team/project. To-dos exist only inside of lists. You need to create a list first. The fields of a todo are: title, description, assigned-to (with a checkbox to notify them or not), due on (with the possibility of span them on more days), when done notify, notes (multimedia). It is possible to discuss tasks, like you discuss files e documents. The lower part of the single task view is dedicated to this discussion board. Everyone can edit a task, any part of it and the modification are reported in the discussion board. The last ones are shown in it, the older ones are collected in the history. Apparenty is not possible to create sub-tasks. Anyone can see the assignments of a member of the team, clicking on her profile and also her activity, like “edited the readme file”.
- _Schedule_, which is a calendar with upcoming events and tasks.
- _Automatic Check-ins_, to “create recurring questions so you don’t have to pester your team about what’s going on”. This has been described as the killer feature of Basecamp 3 by the Basecamp people themselves. When you set up an HQ, which is the company-wide dashboard (not project/team related) is the first thing they let you set up. There are three ‘default’ check-ins they propose: 1. What will you be working on this week? (weekly) 2. What did you work on today? (daily) 3. Read any good books lately? (monthly). These check-ins are then shown publicly in the dashboard of the check-ins and its possible for everyone to comment them.

It is possible to change the position of any tool in the dashboard, delete or duplicate them.

Build in tools and _doors_. Basecamp 3 doesn't integrate with other tool, but it is possible to add doors to the other tools, which are basically links, that are placed along the built-in tools in the dashbaord. [github door](/product/img/basecamp/github-door.jpeg)

[^1]: [new team or project modal](/product/img/basecamp/new-team-or-project.png). Teams and projects are from a tooling perspective the same. The Basecampo methodolgy prioritize projects over teams, so where I write Project, it's meant Project/Team.

[^2] [the dashboard with the 6 tools](/product/img/basecamp/empty-dashboard-with-the-6-standard-tools.png)

There is a special team, which is the HQ. Not every member of a team or a project in the organisation is part of the HQ, but Basecamp suggests to add everyone to the HQ. Like for teams and projects the HQ has also the six standard tools.

### Shape up

Jason Fried in the introduction of "Shape Up" a book by Ryan Singer, who built the first version of basecamp with Fried and DHH.

> We built Basecamp to execute the techniques in this book. It puts all our project communication, task management, and documentation in one place where designers and programmers work seamlessly together. See How to Implement the Shape Up Method in Basecamp
