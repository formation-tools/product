* GitHub

- ‚ûï clean UI (clearer than GitLab IMHO)
  - we don't want to be the "ugly open source" tool
- ‚ûñ still very old-school navigation
  - pages are new renders, not really SPA (may be a bit of a Rails thing ‚ùì)
  - not always snappy
- ‚ûñ context missing when away from top
  - navigation controls are visible only when at the top of a page
